# Native Spring Boot microservice

## This project shows how to build a native, i.e., native as opposed to bytecode, therefore no JVM is needed, microservice using Spring Boot.

### Why tho?
Although the JVM has implemented many optimizations that allows to run programs that perform comparably to native programs there are occasions where a native program is preferable:

* **Quick initialization**. JVM programs are known to need a warm-up, i.e., takes considerable time, in the order of seconds or even minutes, from launching a program to the point where the program is functional, i.e., can handle requests.  This service usually starts in less than 100ms.ã€€Although there are some workarounds like optimizing the scanning of the `classpath`, separating the client written in C and the server in Java like [nailgun](https://github.com/facebook/nailgun) does, these are workarounds.
  
* **Removing an additional layer: the JVM**. No need to install the JVM in the host, e.g., server, container, where the program runs. Increasing operational efficiency.

* **Native process**. The process can be handled like any other process in the machine, i.e., standard tools like `ps(1)` can be used; on the other hand the tooling for observability available for the JVM, e.g., VisualVM is gone.

* **Smaller program size**. The image is only XXXMB, compared to XXXMB plus the JVM. Think about cheaper hosting, faster copying and generation of images.

* **Smaller memory footprint** 75% according to [this video](https://youtu.be/7WYVJyuy00g?t=256).

* **Less vulenrabilities** Because there is less code as only the reachable code of the JVM is compiled into the image.

* **Fun!!**

### Okay, how?
Using [Spring Native, which is still in beta](https://spring.io/blog/2021/03/11/announcing-spring-native-beta).

#### Prerequisites
* Your JVM supports GraalVM.
```
$ java -version
Picked up JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS: -Dfile.encoding=UTF8
openjdk version "11.0.12" 2021-07-20
OpenJDK Runtime Environment GraalVM CE 21.2.0 (build 11.0.12+6-jvmci-21.2-b08)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM GraalVM CE 21.2.0 (build 11.0.12+6-jvmci-21.2-b08, mixed mode, sharing)
```
See the [Spring Native docs](https://docs.spring.io/spring-native/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-native-build-tools)

* Maven 3


#### Let's do it!
The code is very simple
```java
        @GetMapping("/hello")
        public ResponseEntity<String> greeting(@RequestParam(value = "name",
                defaultValue = "World") final String name) {

            return new ResponseEntity<>(format("Hello %s", name), OK);
        }
```

##### Build
Creates a package using the `native` profile and completely skips the tests `mvn -Pnative -DskipTests package`.
The building process takes considerably longer than the usual `mvn package` as the build process is more complex.

The native binary is created!
```
$ file target/spring-native-microservice
target/spring-native-microservice: Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64
```

```
$ls -lh target/spring-native-microservice
-rwxr-xr-x  1 user45432  staff    66M Aug 27 22:23 target/spring-native-microservice*
```  


#### Run
`target/spring-native-microservice` launches our microservice.


Then we can send a request
```
$ curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/hello?name=user454322"
Hello user454322
```

#### Important points to keep in mind
> there is no class lazy loading (everything shipped in the executable is loaded in memory on startup) and some code can be invoked at build time.

> A static analysis of your application from the main entry point is performed at build time.

> The unused parts are removed at build time.

> Configuration is required for reflection, resources, and dynamic proxies.

> Classpath is fixed at build time.
